Overview: This project implements LinkedListDeque and ArrayDeque data structures, along with a Maximizer class for comparing elements. Automated tests add and remove elements to demonstrate each structureâ€™s behavior and performance characteristics. The LinkedListDeque implementation uses a circular doubly linked list with a sentinel node to efficiently add and remove elements from both ends while avoiding null checks.

  How it works: When running the tests, elements are added and removed from both LinkedListDeque and ArrayDeque. This simulates common use cases and highlights:

  Order of elements and how each structure handles insertion/removal from both ends

  Performance differences between linked and array-backed implementations

  How the Maximizer class evaluates and returns the largest element among comparables

  By comparing the output from each test, you can observe the distinct features and trade-offs of the two implementations
